Before accepting delivery, major appliance products (including refrigeration appliances, washers, dryers, ranges, dishwashers, and some microwaves) should be inspected for defects/damage. If any exist, please notify the driver about damages, ask for options and/or refuse delivery free of charge. Discounts for defects/damage for Walmart Marketplace appliances are subject to the seller's discretion and it is recommended customers refuse delivery for defects/damage to avoid further complications.

A customer may initiate a return of a major appliance for a full refund within 2 days of accepted delivery.
